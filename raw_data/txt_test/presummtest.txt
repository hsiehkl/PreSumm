In this paper, we have used timeseries data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 to build a data-driven model of infection dynamics under social distancing. [CLS] [SEP] We find that the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions with sufficient data can be described by a universal curve where the cumula-tive numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing. [CLS] [SEP] In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. [CLS] [SEP] Surprisingly, we find that the despite the enormous variation in region/state/country characteristics and social policy, the infection dynamics across all regions/countries analyzed can be characterized by two FIG. 8: Scale-free and Erdös-Rényi random networks can reproduce observed dynamics. Simulations of virus spreading on scale-free and Erdös-Rényi random networks with 5,000 nodes were performed as described in the main text and methods. [CLS] [SEP] Scale-free networks were sampled with degree distribution p(k) ∝ 1/k γ , while Erdös-Rényi networks were sampled with mean degree k , shown in each panel title. [CLS] [SEP] The time required for a node to infect its neighbor is sampled from a Gamma distribution with mean µG = 50. Non-Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing standard deviation σG = µG/2 = 25, while Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing σG = µG = 50 (because the Gamma distribution reduces to the exponential distribution when µG = σG). Left column is log-linear plot while right is log-log. Black line is a straight line to guide the eye. [CLS] [SEP] Orange line is fit to the cumulative normal given in Eq. (1). The non-Markovian dynamics produce excellent fits (after the initial stochastic regime) for γ > 3 and for small k , while the fit quality degrades for Markovian dynamics or for smaller γ or large k . [CLS] [SEP] quantities: the predicted number of deaths/confirmed cases in a region N max and a scale σ that sets the natural timescale of infection in a region. [CLS] [SEP] Rescaling time and number of deaths/confirmed cases by these two quantities resulted in a remarkable data collapse of infection dynamics across regions, providing strong evidence for our claim of universal dynamics under current social distancing policies. Our analysis also suggests that, for countries and re-gions that have crossed the 50 death threshold, the predictive power of any statistical model based on tracking deaths or cases is likely to be extremely limited until a few days before the infection peaks. [CLS] [SEP] This suggests that it is very difficult to make predictions before curves start flattening. However, after the infection peaks, the uncertainty drops dramatically. [CLS] [SEP] This suggests that while it is very hard to make predictions early on, at later times it is possible to predict both the severity and duration of the infections with much more confidence. This uncertainty is present even though social policies may not be changing much. We have used our statistical model to make forecasts for regions, states, and countries where we have enough data. Importantly, our forecasts assume that there will be no dramatic shifts in social distancing policies. While we use the same fitting function as the IHME, our fitting procedures have crucial differences in the assumptions they make. Crucially, the IHME fitting procedure makes specific assumptions about the effects of social distancing and places strong priors on fitting parameters. [CLS] [SEP] In contrast, our model is agnostic to any social distancing procedures or population characteristics and fits each region and country independently. Nonetheless, we are able to obtain very good fits to the data. While many of the predictions between the two models show good agreement, there are some prominent disparities. [CLS] [SEP] For example using data up to April 15th for the US state of Massachussets, the IHME model predicts that there will be more than 8,200 deaths (with confidence intervals between 1,680 and 25,347) and the infection will peak on May 5th. [CLS] [SEP] In contrast, our model predicts 1,993 deaths (with confidence intervals between 1,302 and 5,366), with a peak time of April 14th. [CLS] [SEP] This likely reflects the fact that the IHME model imposes a large penalty on Massachusetts for its somewhat less stringent social distancing policies. A similar explanation likely holds for the case of Florida. [CLS] [SEP] It will be interesting to compare and contrast these two distinct approaches to fitting to better understand how to best forecast COVID-19 disease dynamics assuming that social policies continue as is. [CLS] [SEP] We also provided a preliminary exploration of how social distancing policies affect the parameters of the universal dynamics. [CLS] [SEP] To do so, we made use of the countryspecific social stringency index compiled by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker [16] . [CLS] [SEP] While there were some anecdotal features in the per-capita fatalities of the most lax and most stringent countries, much more work needs to be done to adequately understand how different stringencies of social distancing affect disease spreading dynamics. [CLS] [SEP] One important caveat of our analysis of the effects of social distancing is that our statistical modeling approach is geared towards countries with relatively large death totals. [CLS] [SEP] Our model has little to say about countries like South Korea (about 230 deaths on April 15th) that have used extensive testing and social distancing to successfully contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more work will have to be done to understand this in greater detail. [CLS] [SEP] We emphasize that our statistical model is neither capable of, nor designed to, understand what will happen if policies change substantially. [CLS] [SEP] All of the countries we have analyzed have adopted significant social distancing protocols. [CLS] [SEP] Since we do not explicitly incorporate the effects of policy in our fits, we have no way of asking about what will happen if these policies change significantly. [CLS] [SEP] Nonetheless, there seem to be some general lessons to be learned. [CLS] [SEP] First, despite all the variation across regions and countries, cases and deaths seem to quickly cross over from exponential to power law growth. [CLS] [SEP] Similar behavior was observed in other epidemics including HIV/AIDS and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [24, 28] . [CLS] [SEP] This suggests that it is useful to plot all data in both log-linear and loglog scales. Second, it cautions against making extrapolations far into the future based on exponential growth, since power law growth seems to be quite consistent and generic. Finally, to better understand the origin of these dynamics, we performed simulations of disease spreading on social interaction networks. [CLS] [SEP] We focused on dynamics where the time it takes an individual to infect their neighbors follows a non-Markovian waiting time distribution. Furthermore, we assumed that individuals could have significant heterogeneity in their infection times. [CLS] [SEP] With these assumptions, we were able to reproduce the universal dynamics observed in real COVID-19 data using our simulations. While much more work needs to be done to understand the origin of this universal dynamics, these simulations suggest that the combination of non-Markovian dynamics and significant heterogeneity among individual transmission times may be crucial factors governing disease spreading dynamics.
