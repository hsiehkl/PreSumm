We aimed to discover critical insights on the endemic/epidemic/pandemic characteristics of the While TPL-b appears rather stable or even invariant with time and/or space, the population aggregation critical density (PACD) (i. [CLS] [SEP]e., M 0 or infection critical threshold), which is the level at which infections are random and below which infections may be stabilized, can depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time (disease or outbreak stages), and space (regions). [CLS] [SEP] We postulate that M 0 should also be influenced by public-health interventions such as quarantines and travel restrictions. [CLS] [SEP] Therefore, M 0 can be an important epidemiological parameter for evaluating the characteristics of disease outbreaks. [CLS] [SEP] For example, COVID-19 exhibited significantly lower threshold (M 0 ) than SARS, suggesting a potentially lower infection "tolerance" threshold of COVID-19. [CLS] [SEP] Nevertheless, it should be cautioned that the "tolerance" threshold only means the level of random infections, which may signal the level of stabilized infections. [CLS] [SEP] However, whether or not the "tolerance" threshold is biometrically tolerable or safe depends on other biomedical characteristics, among which Allee effects can be a critical factor to determine whether or not the infections will die off or persist. [CLS] [SEP] We postulate that if M 0 coincide or is below the level Allee effects in action, the infections may die off. [CLS] [SEP] Second, all datasets we tested easily passed the neutrality test with HDP-MSN and indicated that The ratio of Q=M/θ may be used as a measure of the relative importance of "infection spread via migration" vs. [CLS] [SEP] "infections spread via local contagion" in spreading the infections, with larger Q indicating higher migration role and smaller Q indicating higher local contagion. [CLS] [SEP] Third, both the TPL scaling law and metapopulation modeling may complement each other. [CLS] [SEP] The difference (closeness) between M 0 (the infection critical threshold from TPL) and θ (local contagion or "speciation" rate from metapopulation modeling) may signal the effectiveness of completely blocking the migration (dispersal) in spreading infections. [CLS] [SEP] For example, in the case of COVID-19 infections in China, both parameters (M 0 and θ) are rather close to each other and their difference is only approximately 0. [CLS] [SEP]6, suggesting that, without external inputs, the infections from local contagion is only approximately 0.6 higher than the infection critical threshold (M 0 ). [CLS] [SEP] This makes the mission of controlling local contagion for stabilizing infections much less challenging than the mission when θ >> M 0. [CLS] [SEP] Finally, we suggest that the approaches demonstrated previously should be of general applicability for epidemiological research. [CLS] [SEP] In particular, we consider TPL-b can be a pathogen specific parameter, primarily shaped by evolutionary forces.
