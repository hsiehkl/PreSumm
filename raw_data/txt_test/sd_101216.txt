As with Plato's cave, there are stark differences between how we perceive risk and the reality or the calculated level of risk, which can result in totally different behavioral outcomes. [CLS] [SEP] Risk attitudes clearly shape behavioral responses to pandemics. [CLS] [SEP] The actual health risks of the COVID-19 pandemic are (most likely) low for most groups apart from the elderly (40, 41) . [CLS] [SEP] In terms of mortality, the overall health consequences of Covid-19 could be similar to a pandemic influenza 13 (42) . [CLS] [SEP] Nevertheless, risk attituderather than actual riskinfluence real behavioral activity. [CLS] [SEP] Our results demonstrate the sharp shifts in the relation between behavioral activity and risk attitudes before and after declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, as well as shifts before and after the first related death was recorded. [CLS] [SEP] The first thing that becomes apparent is that behavior and our willingness to take on risks have both shifted dramatically since the baseline period in mid-February. [CLS] [SEP] At this stage, only three deaths were recorded outside mainland China 14 (one in Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines) and life was proceeding as normal. [CLS] [SEP] There was no imminent perception of a threat of the worldwide pandemic to come, reflected in the baseline reporting of behavior and the willingness to take risks. [CLS] [SEP] However, when we compare this to the first and second sample period, we observe mostly negative shifts in behavior (excluding residential) but a mixed set of reactions to risk. [CLS] [SEP] Several categories saw a substantial negative shift in visits, including Retail & Recreation, Transit Stations, and Workplaces; compared to the baseline, visiting behaviors had already started to drop off before the pandemic announcement but dropped off again afterward. [CLS] [SEP] During this first period, we can see that social distancing and work from home was starting to make an impact, as people stopped travelling to and from work (especially through crowded transit stations) and also stopped engaging in non-essential retail shopping (therapy). [CLS] [SEP] After the pandemic was officially announced, we see a second wave of behavioral shifts as more people reduce their travel, shopping and more either lose their jobs or are in shutdown mode. [CLS] [SEP] However, we do observe an interesting shift in risk attitudes across these three categories as they all exhibit a slightly positive trend in the period before the announcement, but they all shift to a much stronger negative risk trend after the announcement. [CLS] [SEP] Given that 'flattening the curve' was the strategic focus for most governments, the social distancing message appears to have been received even prior to most lockdown measures. [CLS] [SEP] Conversely, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, and Residential had much smaller shifts both before and after the announcements when compared to the baseline. [CLS] [SEP] However, the shifts in Grocery & Pharmacy and Parkswhile much smaller than the other categoriesappear to undergo a large risk preference-mobility shift; that is, the first set of behavioral changes results in a positive sloping risk function that flipped into a negative sloped function after the pandemic announcement. [CLS] [SEP] While seemingly at odds with expectations, one may want to consider what the announcement of the pandemic would have meant to most individuals. [CLS] [SEP] With a looming threat of lockdown and isolation, at this point individuals would have ramped up shopping to stock up for likely upcoming government lockdown. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, those with an affinity for the outdoors may have wanted to enjoy their parks and outdoor lifestyle as much as possible before it was banned. [CLS] [SEP] This is in line with the reported shifts in the number of visits, which while still negative overall, indicate that the change to number of visits is less negative than prior to the announcement. [CLS] [SEP] The odd one out is the Residential visits category; while small, we can still observe double increases in visitation numbers both pre and post the official pandemic announcement, and there is no change in the function representing the willingness to take risks. [CLS] [SEP] When interpreting these statistics, we need to bear in mind the 'normal' weekly habits of people; that is, work during the week and undertake other activities/pastimes on the weekends. [CLS] [SEP] In order to ensure we capture the shift in behavior, we compare the weekday behaviors and risk attitudes to that of the weekends. [CLS] [SEP] Our result demonstrates that there are a few differences between weekdays and weekends, as one would expect that on weekends there are slightly more activities taking place other than work. [CLS] [SEP] Furthermore, we see little variance in the slopes of weekdays and weekends risk attitudes. [CLS] [SEP] The large negative shifts across all categories except workplaces after the official declaration, but much smaller variations between weekdays and weekends before the declaration, further supports the discussion above: that the behavior had already started to change well before the declaration of a pandemic, with many individuals starting to increase their weekend activities. [CLS] [SEP] However, after the pandemic was announced, a raft of measures that tried to limit the spread of the virus resulted in a very large change in most economies due to closure of businesses and job losses. [CLS] [SEP] This fundamental change in economic activities and loss of work left very little to differentiate weekends from weekdays for a large number of people, which is reflected in the large negative changes in the comparisons. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to the announcement, we see that the function on willingness to take risk is fairly flat or slightly downward sloping, but risk perceptions change significantly for all categories after the announcement. [CLS] [SEP] The most interesting changes are in Workplace and Residential, exhibiting a relatively large increase in the willingness to take high risks: this could be explained through people wanting to visit family and friends or the increased willingness to work despite the risk of infection. [CLS] [SEP] In general, throughout our analysis we observe that less risk-tolerating regions more actively adjust their behavioral patterns in response to the pandemic. [CLS] [SEP] Risk seeking regions are less responsive to protective measures. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, the tendency towards being more careless or more cautious carries substantial behavioral implications that is also affected by different levels of opportunity costs, as evidenced by the weekend effect. [CLS] [SEP] Regional differences seem to matter, offering support for a "regional personality factor" in risk taking. [CLS] [SEP] As with individuals who allocate themselves to more risky professions there are regions that are likely more likely acting as "stunt persons", "fire-fighter", or "race-car driver regions". [CLS] [SEP] Risk takers therefore seem to demonstrate a lower preference for their own and communal safety, as demonstrated that risk averse regions with higher percentages of 65+ people are more actively to increase social isolation by staying at home. [CLS] [SEP] Such behavioral differences due to risk preferences may indicate different levels of homeostatic responses. [CLS] [SEP] Risk aversion seems to promote a stronger fluctuation around a target level. [CLS] [SEP] For example, if you are driving on a motorway and it starts to rain or snow, what do you do? [CLS] [SEP] Our result would imply that risk averse individuals may be more likely to slow down to reduce the likelihood of having an accident. [CLS] [SEP] Risk averse individuals have a higher need for risk compensation. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, the level of risk at which a person feels best is maintained homeostatically in relation to factors such as emotional or physiological experiences (19) . [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the lack of adjustment among risk taking regions is interesting, as many settings that explore risk taking behavior are connected to the possibility of attracting social fame and praise, financial gains, or other potential positive outcomes. [CLS] [SEP] In our setting, the risks are strongly attached to the loss of their own and other's health or life without achieving major gains, although positive utility gains also arise from not restricting one's usual activities. [CLS] [SEP] It seems like the risk takers are more "pathologically" stable during such environmentally challenging circumstances. [CLS] [SEP] It is almost as if risk taking regions are more determined to maintain settings as activity-oriented, while risk averse regions are more goaloriented in achieving social distancing. [CLS] [SEP] The current analysis is interesting, as a large number of studies exploring the implications of risk are based on cross-sectional samples or between-subject designs in laboratory settings. [CLS] [SEP] In this case, the danger is more prolonged, lasting over several weeks or months, compared with other risk situations such as driving a car. [CLS] [SEP] Automatic or response "scripts" become less relevant as individuals have the chance to think about their actions and adjust their behavior accordingly. [CLS] [SEP] Strategic, tactical, or operational factors become more dominant while perceptual, emotional, and motivational factors remain active. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, individuals do not face a single "either-or" decision but are required to constantly evaluate their choices to go out or stay at home. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, cognitive reevaluation is a core feature in our setting, and is based on dynamic feedback loops. [CLS] [SEP] Risk loving regions are also less likely to adjust their behavior based on external stimulus such as the WHO announcement of classifying COVID-19 as a pandemic. [CLS] [SEP] A core limitation is that we are only able to explore human behavior at the regional and not individual level. [CLS] [SEP] Studies that use individual data could focus in more detail on individual differences such as age or gender or differences in affective reactions or perceived locus of control and could try to disentangle perceptions (risk preferences) partly from actual risk as statistics provide detailed information on the actual age risk profile. [CLS] [SEP] Such a study would provide a better understanding of habit changes, as well as potentially reveal motivational reasons for behavioral changes or behavioral stickiness. [CLS] [SEP] To reduce levels of uncertainty or ambiguity, individuals will try to gain control over a situation or they will change their preferences to better the fit the situation, and thus try to gain control in a secondary way (19) . [CLS] [SEP] Other psychological factors such as overconfidence may also matter. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, we do not have information about the actual level of social mobility in the baseline time period. [CLS] [SEP] If that information were available, one could argue that those who had the highest levels of mobility prior to the lockdown have had the largest relative loss; we should therefore observe this group exhibiting the most risk seeking behavior and breaking the lockdown rules. [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand, those who previously had the least amount of social mobility have in relative terms only suffered a small lossand should be much less likely to break the lockdown rules. [CLS] [SEP] However, this may adjust over time, as individuals habituate to the changes and reset their reference points. [CLS] [SEP] This fits nicely into the suggestion that "a person who has not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise" (29, p. [CLS] [SEP] 287), which is consistent with risk preference changes in a disaster situation (10). Risk is a fascinating topic as we have two forces in place. [CLS] [SEP] Based on evolutionary theory, people are risk-inclined but also control-inclined. [CLS] [SEP] Risk taking is necessary to cope with environmental changes and the constant level of uncertainty and danger. [CLS] [SEP] On other hand, control of the environment is required to reduce risks that go beyond the desired levels or that may pose danger to one's survival (19) . [CLS] [SEP] The pandemic declaration caused a fundamental shift in behavior, independently of government lockdown measures. [CLS] [SEP] Future studies could explore in more detail how information dissemination and media reporting are connected to behavioral responses and the level of risk taking within regions. [CLS] [SEP] Removal of the lockdown policies is likely to be undertaken cautiously and slowly rather than via one large change. [CLS] [SEP] It is unclear at this stage how changesparticularly among the risk averse regionshave already led to new habit formation that will not readjust to previously normal settings. [CLS] [SEP] Future studies will provide more insights into such a question.
